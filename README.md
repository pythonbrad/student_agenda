# Student's agenda

## Problem:
### Many students of UB (University of BUEA) match problems of informations (often caused by the disturbance of the network):
- When the timetable has been changed or not
- When a lecturer has cancelled or programmed a course
- When the attendance has been done or not
- When the lecturer is present of not
- When an assignment, tutorial or other document has been given or not
- To have informations after an absence (history of activities who has been or not)
- To find past informations (documents, events,...)
### Hence have the good information at good instant, it is not easy.

## Solution:
### To solve this problem, we propose a fast and light application (and able send informations to students offline) who will be managed by the course delegate or not and who will permit:
- To see the timetable the most update
- To be informed when the timetable has changed or not, the lecturer is present of not
- To find and download a document given (same after many months)
- At a student to inform the course delegate of his absence
- To evict the repetitive diffusions of the same informations
