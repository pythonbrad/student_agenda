1) Introduction
    ...

    a) Structure and Destription
        This is the base structure of this project
        frontend
            |______app
            |       |______templates
            |       |______init.js
            |       |______addons.js
            |       
            |______assets

        In the app folder, we will have all script directly link to the app or script who will be modify or create while the development of this application
        In the templates folder, we will have just the html file used like view or part of view.
        The file init.js will contains the core of this application
        The file addons.js will contains, the scripts who will be used by the application but who can be used out of this application.
    b) Why this structure?
        Inspired of django (MVT).
2) The file init.js
    A) Structure
        App = {
            views: {
                base: function (next=function () {}) {
                    $(callback).load(page);
                    setTimeout(function () {
                        next();
                    }, delay);
                },
                splash: function (...) {
                    ...
                },
                home: function (...) {
                    App.views.splash(
                        function () {
                            // We perform operation
                            // ...
                        };
                    )
                },
                ...
                logout: function (...) {...},
            },
            models: {...},
            events: {...},
            vars: {...},
        };

    B) Destription
        a) Views
            All script in views represent a view of the application.
            The splash and base views are independent, because:
                -the base view loads the base template and permit to do some changing after this loading.
                -the splash view loads a splash screen to perform some operation in background without decrease the user's experience.
            A view is represented by 3 parts:
                -the first part represents the reception or not of the datas from user.
                -the second part represents the loading of the splash screen and executing of some operations in background.
                -the third part represents the loading of the template or part of template linked to the views.
        b) Models
            All data linked to an object will be store here.
        c) Events
            All events generated by setTimeout and setInterval will be stored here.
        d) Vars
            All tempory vars who will use from a view to another view, will be store here.
    C) Why this structure
        Inspired of Django (MVT).
3) The file addons.js
    addons = {
        function_name: function (...) {...},
        ...,
        function_name: function (...) {...},
    }
